        <p>Vegetarian cuisine is based on food that meets vegetarian standards by not including meat and animal tissue
            products (such as gelatin or animal-derived rennet). Lacto-ovo vegetarianism (the most common type of
            vegetarianism in the Western world) includes eggs and dairy products (such as milk and cheese without
            rennet). Lacto vegetarianism includes dairy products but not eggs, and ovo vegetarianism encompasses eggs
            but not dairy products. The strictest form of vegetarianism is veganism, which excludes all animal products,
            including dairy, honey, and some refined sugars if filtered and whitened with bone char.
